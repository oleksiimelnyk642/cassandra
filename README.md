I wrote an article "My first Cassandra cluster deployment on AWS using CloudFormation", which you can find by this link:
https://medium.com/@oleksii.melnyk643/my-first-cassandra-cluster-deployment-on-aws-using-cloudformation-35840c7c8ebf

At first you need to do:
git clone https://github.com/oleksiimelnyk642/cassandra.git
or
git clone git@github.com:oleksiimelnyk642/cassandra.git

In article described in details how you can use these files.
